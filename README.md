Distributional kernel-based sub-trajectory clustering

This is a sub-trajectory clustering method based on point clustering.

## Run

You could run sub-trajectory clustering on *TRAFFIC* dataset by simply:

IDK-StC could provide the basic information of clustering result, a figure showing the 7 clusters with the most sub-trajectories, and the SSE / OD evaluation score.
